Accompanying research on the Job Guarantee (MAGMA) project - University of Oxford





 

Purpose of the study: The study will independently assess the social and economic impact of the project on participants and the rest of the population. To do this, participants will be interviewed several times throughout the course of the programme in order to visualise what changes over the course of their participation. The personal data and information of the interviewed persons will be treated confidentially, anonymised, and changed in such a way that no one can trace back who they are.

 


	I have read the information sheet for the accompanying research and have had the opportunity to review the information and ask questions, which have been adequately answered.
	I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I may discontinue my continued participation at any time without giving a reason and without adverse consequences or penalties. My previously collected data will be deleted with the exception of those data that have already been anonymised in the study and whose omission would therefore alter the study results. 
	I understand that only researchers have access to my personal data and that this data will not be passed on to the AMS (except in anonymised form for data linkage), it.works or others. 
	I understand that the data will be stored securely. I understand how this accompanying research will be conducted and what participation will mean for me.
	I understand how to express my concerns or make a complaint.
	Yes, I agree to the terms of this accompanying research and am taking part.
